Pengyuan Li is a Research Staff Member at MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, leading the development of [Granite Vision model]([https://lnkd.in/gbrTmntA](https://huggingface.co/collections/ibm-granite/granite-vision-models-67b3bd4ff90c915ba4cd2800)), a vision-language model specifically designed for visual document understanding. Previously, he served as the Data Acquisition Lead and collected more than 10PB data for building Large Language, Code, and Multimodal Models at IBM. 

Pengyuan's research focuses on machine learning, multimodal data mining, document analysis, and biomedical informatics. He has served as a visiting scholar at Caltech, UCLA, UBC, JHU, and Tongji University, collaborating with researchers around the world to explore innovative, cross-disciplinary ideas. He is also an Adjunct Faculty member at the Data Science Institute, University of Delaware.
